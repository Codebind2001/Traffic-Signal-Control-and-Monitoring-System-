# Traffic-Signal-Control-and-Monitoring-System-
The Intelligent Traffic Signal Control and Monitoring System is a C++-based simulation that automates traffic light transitions to improve road management. It cycles through red, green, and yellow signals using precise timing controlled by the <chrono> library and ensures smooth traffic flow with an infinite loop. The system can be expanded with AI, IoT, and real-time data to optimize signal timings dynamically. Additionally, it highlights the importance of traffic rules and penalties to enhance road safety and reduce congestion, making it a foundation for future smart city traffic solutions.
